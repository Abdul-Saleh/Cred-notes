<h1>Lesson 1: Introduction to Candlestick Charts</h1>

## What is Technical Analysis
- Making prababilistic forecasts of future price behaviour based on price history
- Finding riske-defined entries/exits on intruments that a speculator wants to be long/short
- It is not a way to predict future price behavior 
- Overall it is a risk management tool


## Candlestick Anatomy
- Candlestick charts are one version of a price chart
- Widest used format 
- Anatomy: Colour, Body and Wick
- **Colours**
	- **Red/Bearish candle** - Closing price was lower thann opening price
	- **Green/Bullish** - Closing price was higher than opening price
- **Candle bodies**
	- **Red/Bearish candle** - Upper Body is the opening price & lower is closing price
	- **Green/Bullish** - Lower Body is the opening price and Upper is opening price
- Candle wicks
	- **Upper wick** - Highest price point within a given time frame
	- **Lower wick** - Lowest price point within a given time frame


## CandleStick OHLC
- Hovering over a candlestick the OHLC should appear 
	- Open 
	- High
	- Low
	- Close
- This is useful for mapping out signifcant price levels
	- Weekly open
	- Daily open
	- High of day/ Low of day
	- Precise high/low of a given move
	- Whether price closed through a level or swing point

## Time Frames
- The timeframe you choose dictates the time period that 1 candle represents 
- Higher time frame candles are comprised of lower time frame candles
- Candle closes are signifcant - Don't get ahead of yourself before  acandle close
	- Good idea to wait for a candle to close on the timeframe your trading in befoere taking a position
- As a beginner focus on a few time frames typically higher time frames to not caught up on noise 
	- E.g. Daily/ hourly time frames


## Candlestick Patterns
- Many different patterns
	-   Swing High/Swing Low (more of a price pattern)
	-   Doji
	-   Shooting Star/Hammer
	-   Engulfing
	-   Tweezers

-   When it comes to candlestick patterns, I implore you to take a nuanced approach
	-   Beginners, having just learned all sorts of patterns, start looking for them everywhere and trying to trade based on patterns alone â†’ bad idea 
-   My suggestion: look for higher time frame, clear patterns where it makes sense to do so
	-   E.g. no point looking for reversal patterns in a tight range, but makes more sense to pay attention to a reversal pattern where there is a strong trend (up or down)
    



# Again:  use Higher time Frames and Zoom out
